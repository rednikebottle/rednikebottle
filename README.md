👋 Hey, I’m Nick!

Currently figuring out how to build cool things that actually work.

→ NTU Data Science & AI student
→ Love clean code, efficient systems, and solving messy problems
→ Learning mostly by breaking things (and fixing them again)
→ Working on projects around: energy tech ⚡, smart platforms 🧠, and making data useful 📊

Tech I’m playing with:

Python | Java | JavaScript | R 

Node.js | Express | Firebase | Next.js | React

SQL | NoSQL | Firestore

Data Analytics | ML (sometimes)

“Shipping beats perfection.”
Let’s build something that people actually want to use.
